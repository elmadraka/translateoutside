# Translate Outside

So I made this set of tools to ease the translation of Map***.json files for the game Look Outside.

1 - Just select the files (Map***.json) on the left input and you can easily read a TSV with the strings that need translation.

2 - You can download the TSV files and translate them in a spreadsheet or you can copy that result and paste it on the right textarea where you can translate the strings wanted and click to export as a Map***.json file.

3 - Then you can override this file in the /data folder of the game.
